## Copyright

This is a free font/file, distribute as you wish to who you wish. Do NOT sell
this font within a CD or any other media; it's not yours and you can't make
money of it. You'd rather ask me first via email, I may probably let you do it
as long as it's for a good cause.

I don't know if the original Nokia font has some copyright which prevents
people from making new fonts based on it. I hope not. Anyways, buy a Nokia,
and I think everything's gonna be alright.

Special thanks on this version go out to Carlos BÃªla (www.goldenshower.gs) and
Diogo Kalil (www.sincolor.com.br) for helping me out with the Mac version of
the font. It has been extensively tested to ensure it's as smooth (hint,
kerning, spacing and aliasing-wise) as the pc one is.
