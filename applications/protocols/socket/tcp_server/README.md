# tcp_server Example
## Configuration project
By default, the connected wifi AP in this project is `ssid="ssid"` and `password="password"`.
You need to modify it according to your own AP configuration.
```c
#define ROUTER_SSID "ssid"
#define ROUTER_PWD "password"
```
**Server default configuration**

- IP Address: station IPv4 addr
- Port: `7878`

```c
#define TCP_SERVER_PORT 7878
```
The current project supports simultaneous access of `4 clients`, you are at `src/tcp_ Server.c` can modify the following macro definitions to modify the maximum number of connections.
```c
#define MAX_CLIENT_NUM 4
```
## build and download
Compile with instructions and download firmware.
```shell
make -j16 flash p=/dev/ttyUSB0 b=921600
```
**j16:j16 is the number of cores in the system**

### Message Receiving and Sending
When the client access succeeds, the server forwards the message to the client when it receives itï¼š
```shell
(other log)...
client:192.168.1.106:1,id:0
client:192.168.1.106:2,id:1
192.168.1.106:Jdkdj

192.168.1.106:Jdkdj
192.168.1.106:Jdkdj
192.168.1.106:Jdkdj
192.168.1.106:Jdkdj
...
```
When a `close` is received, the current connection is closed.
