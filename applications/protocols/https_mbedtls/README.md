# HTTP server with TLS support using mbedTLS

Simple HTTPS example that uses mbedTLS to establish a secure socket connection using the certificate bundle with two custom certificates added for verificationã€‹

## Configure WiFi Connected

Please configure the ssid and password that need to be connected to WiFi in advance,in `main.c`.

```c
#define ROUTER_SSID "your ssid"
#define ROUTER_PWD "your password"
```

## Compile and download

**Compile command**

```shell
make -j16
```

`-j16`is the number of cores in the system.

**download**

```shell
make flash p=/dev/ttyUSBx b=921600
```

`/dev/ttyUSBx`is the port number of the Ai-WB2 connection, usually ttyUSB0
