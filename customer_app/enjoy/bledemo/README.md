```c
gpio2 {
    status = "okay";
    pin = <12>;
    feature = "button";
    active = "Hi";
    mode = "multipress";
    button {
        debounce = <10>;
        short_press_ms {
            start = <100>;
            end = <2000>;
            kevent = <2>;
        };
        long_press_ms {
            start = <3000>;
            end = <5000>;
            kevent = <3>;
        };
        longlong_press_ms {
            start = <10000>;
            kevent = <4>;
        };
        trig_level = "Lo";
    };
    hbn_use = "disable";
};
